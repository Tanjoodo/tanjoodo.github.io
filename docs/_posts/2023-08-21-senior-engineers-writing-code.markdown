# Introduction
A lot of software engineers -including me- have joined this industry out of love for code. It is very rewarding to build
software and see it come to life, but unfortunately, after a certain number of years in the industry, we start finding
ourselves inundated with an increasing number of tasks that are beyond what we have originally signed up for. 

A common theme among engineers approaching seniority is feeling frustrated at the diminishing amount of code they get
to write on a daily basis. Instead, they find themselves being up to their eyeballs in documents, emails and hours of meetings.
This is especially frustrating when a project seems to be not moving well beyond the ideation or planning stage.

In this article, I argue that these tasks present a bigger opportunity to impact code than through directly writing it,
and that a successful engineer should also welcome this added responsibility as it signals the organization's trust in
this individual's skills and a desire to scale them to the next level. Finally, I will be giving out some guidance on
how to make sure you're still writing code in your day-to-day, even if you take on these responsibilities.

# Your impact on code by writing it is limited
Understanding the impact that you have on the code that you write is straightforward. You write it, it's there. You
refactor it, it's better. You add tests to it, it's easier to change. At the start of your career, your performance and
skills are measured directly through the code that you write. The quality and speed of delivery for it both play a
significant part in your evaluation. The problems you face are in the terms of classes, packages, building, testing and
running your code. It is a good life, and for me, I could hardly believe I was paid to do this! 

As time goes by, you find your code is starting to become more refined. You are receiving a lot of helpful information
either through feedback, training, reading design documents put forth by engineers more senior than you, or through
other avenues for learning. You find yourself raising your bar on code quality, writing unit and integration
tests out of habit, and being trusted to design larger and larger portions of the code base.

This process that you have gone through as a junior has shaped the way you approach problems and write code. It has
made you a better engineer. This process, however, did not evolve by accident. It was crafted and constantly refined by
engineers more senior than you. As you approach seniority, you will be expected to become the senior engineer in many
juniors' development stories.

As a senior engineer, you are presented with opportunities to impact code in much larger ways than before. Your work,
either by direct influence, or by passive leading by example, affects not only the code you write, but the code your
whole organization writes. And as someone who has done their fair share of writing code, you are well-positioned to
take advantage of this position.

# How you can scale up your impact
But how can you actually take advantage of this influence that you possess? It start by coming to a very important
realization: Software development, much like many lines of work, is a people problem. The code is an artifact to the way
people are functioning in an organization, rather than the problem or solution itself. Your job as a senior engineer is
to support the organization in solving the hard problems.

## Development Processes
The most direct way to influence code through people is to create, enhance, maintain and socialize your organization's
development processes. This can be by enhancing, creating, maintaining or socializing code reviews, design reviews or
deployment procedures. You can also leave an outsized impact by automating a lot of these processes, plugging in static
analysis tools to the team's code reviews, or automating error-prone manual steps when deploying services or running
them locally. 

Being a senior engineer, you are well-positioned to make the calls on these processes as you have seen what works and
what doesn't and you are also knowledgable in the code and architecture of your company's software.

## Being a source of truth for leadership
Having earned wisdom in your career, seeing what works and what doesn't, paired with the close-to-the-ground nature of
your work, means that are well-equipped to relay accurate and actionable information to your leadership. This can affect
staffing decisions, strategic calls, and set expectations for when the next business initiative can be delivered.

This not only gives your team a chance to get the funding to finally deprecate a service, or pay off some technical
debt, but also gives your team breathing room to be able to deliver comfortably without having to create unnecessary
tech debt and with realistic expectations.

## Mentoring and developing junior talents
Make sure to position yourself as a helpful engineer who will give answers and provide support to people who need it.
This will put you in a powerful position to educate and influence how other team members approach problems and implement
solutions. This will also give you the chance to know what each team member is working on and gives you a high level
understanding of where your organization is heading. You can use this information to steer the ship as discussed in the
previous section.

## Setting the bar for code quality
As a well-known highly skilled and senior engineer, the way you carry yourself is important. If you are cutting corners,
so will the interns. You can enhance the level of quality of your entire team by simply operating at that level and
showing people two things: 

1. That quality work can be achieved
2. How quality work can be achieved

In a lot of environments, engineers will feel the pressure to deliver at the expense of quality. Being a successful
engineer with much experience, the work that you do that is of exceptional quality as well as on-time can show that in
fact quality can be achieved. You can also show how and when compromises are taken and help inform your team on how to
make similar decisions simply by doing your work.

You can also take a more active role in setting the bar for code quality. You have an unofficial authority to
influence parameters for code quality such as acceptable testing coverage, code review size, and other parameters that
control the quality of the code. Lead the charge in aligning with the rest of the team on these parameters and you can
watch the quality of the code and the discourse around it improve.

# How to actually end up writing more code
You may have been unsatisfied in the answers of this blog, or you simply don't think you have the desire to take on the
added responsibilities. Don't worry, there are still ways to get your coding time back. 

## Talk to your manager
The most direct answer is this. Talk to your manager. Make sure they understand the kind of work you'd rather be doing
and align with them on steps to achieve that. Your manager might be thinking that they are providing you with an
opportunity to grow into your role, but the opportunities may be too early, or they may be not as effective as expected
towards your career growth. Or you may just want more time to write more code. 

## Use your influence to give yourself more coding opportunities
Chances are, you're going to be given the opportunity to make decisions on behalf of the organization. You may find
yourself able to give _yourself_ those opportunities to write code. It may be in the shape of a design that requires a
new implementation, or a task that requires someone to change code on the critical path in an area you're most familiar
with. As the owner of this project, you can assign yourself these opportunities to shine. 

Be careful not to take opportunities that would be easy for you, but would have been a good challenge for a junior
engineer that they could use to grow. And make sure to use these coding opportunities to set the bar. Involve everyone
in reviewing your code changes and have healthy discussions about what you are doing. 

## Give yourself time to code
You may have been given the green light by your manager to pick up more coding tasks, or you've found a way to further
the organization's goals while still getting some coding in. But you still find yourself drowning in emails, documents
and meetings, still. 

Programming needs large blocks of uninterrupted time (see: [Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)).
A 30 minute meeting in the middle of a 6 hour block has split this block in half and made it two much less useful 3 and
2.5 hour blocks. You will need to block this time and defend it with your life. 

You might find that you have already agreed to a lot of meeting that really fragmented your calendar. What you can do is
write-off that week or sprint, and block your calendar 1 or 2 weeks in advance for the next spring. Block your calendar
generously so that if you have to give away some of it, you still end up with a good chunk of coding time.

# Conclusion
Writing and reading code is one of the biggest pleasures for a software engineer. However, good software engineers find
themselves rewarded with tasks that detract them from interacting directly with code. These opportunities provide a
chance for engineers to impact code at scale that is larger than their own individual contributions, making sure that
the org as a whole is writing better code and delivering better value to the business.

Your problems may be about balancing those new responsibilities with the responsibility of writing code, but you find
yourself unable to make much progress due to continuous interruption. You will need to become better at defending your
time, and becoming comfortable with declining meetings or setting expectations on email replies or documents to read or
write. You may need to block your time weeks in advance to make sure you meet your current commitments while still
setting the expectations for any new engagements in the future.
